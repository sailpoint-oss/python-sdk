# sailpoint.v2025.SourceUsagesApi
  Use this API to implement source usage insight functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can gather information and insights about how their tenants&#39; sources are being used.
This allows organizations to get the information they need to start optimizing and securing source usage.
 
All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v2025*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**get-status-by-source-id**](#get-status-by-source-id) | **GET** `/source-usages/{sourceId}/status` | Finds status of source usage
[**get-usages-by-source-id**](#get-usages-by-source-id) | **GET** `/source-usages/{sourceId}/summaries` | Returns source usage insights


## get-status-by-source-id
Finds status of source usage
This API returns the status of the source usage insights setup by IDN source ID.

## get-usages-by-source-id
Returns source usage insights
This API returns a summary of source usage insights for past 12 months.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/get-usages-by-source-id)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | source_id | **str** | True  | ID of IDN source
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | sorters | **str** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **date**

### Return type
[**List[SourceUsage]**](../models/source-usage)
