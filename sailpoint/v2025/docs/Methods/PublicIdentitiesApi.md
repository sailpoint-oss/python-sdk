# sailpoint.v2025.PublicIdentitiesApi
  Use this API in conjunction with [Public Identites Config](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/public-identities-config/) to enable non-administrators to view identities&#39; publicly visible attributes. 
With this functionality in place, non-administrators can view identity attributes other than the default attributes (email, lifecycle state, and manager), depending on which identity attributes their organization administrators have made public. 
This can be helpful for access approvers, certification reviewers, managers viewing their direct reports&#39; access, and source owners viewing their tasks.

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**get-public-identities**](#get-public-identities) | **GET** `/public-identities` | Get list of public identities

Get a list of public identities.  Set `add-core-filters` to `true` to exclude incomplete identities and uncorrelated accounts.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/get-public-identities)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | filters | **str** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **alias**: *eq, sw*  **email**: *eq, sw*  **firstname**: *eq, sw*  **lastname**: *eq, sw*
  Query | add_core_filters | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true*, only get identities which satisfy ALL the following criteria in addition to any criteria specified by *filters*:   - Should be either correlated or protected.   - Should not be \"spadmin\" or \"cloudadmin\".   - uid should not be null.   - lastname should not be null.   - email should not be null.
  Query | sorters | **str** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name**

### Return type
