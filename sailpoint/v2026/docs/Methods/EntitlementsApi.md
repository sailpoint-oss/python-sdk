## get-account-entitlements
Get entitlements for an account
This API returns a list of all entitlements associated with the given account ID. The account must exist; if not found, the API returns 404.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2026/get-account-entitlements)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | account_id | **str** | True  | The account ID to get entitlements for
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | search_after | **str** |   (optional) | Used to begin the search window at the values specified.  This parameter consists of the last values of the sorted fields in the current record set.  searchAfter length must match the number of sorters.  This is used to expand the Elasticsearch limit of 10K records by shifting the 10K window to begin at this value.  It is recommended that you always include the ID of the object in addition to any other fields on this parameter in order to ensure you don't get duplicate results while paging.  For example, if you are sorting by name you will also want to include ID, for example searchAfter=Account Payable,2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221&sorters=name,id.  If the last entitlement ID in the search result is 2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221 and the last name is \"Account Payable\", then using that name and ID will start a new search after this entitlement.
  Query | sorters | **str** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **id, name, created, modified, type, attribute, value, source.id, requestable**
