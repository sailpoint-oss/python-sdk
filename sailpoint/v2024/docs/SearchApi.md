# **search_aggregate**
> AggregationResult search_aggregate(search, offset=offset, limit=limit, count=count)

Perform a Search Query Aggregation

Performs a search query aggregation and returns the aggregation result. By default, you can page a maximum of 10,000 search result records.  To page past 10,000 records, you can use searchAfter paging.  Refer to [Paginating Search Queries](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-search-queries) for more information about how to implement searchAfter paging.

Perform Search

Perform a search with the provided query and return a matching result collection. To page past 10,000 records, you can use `searchAfter` paging.  Refer to [Paginating Search Queries](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-search-queries) for more information about how to implement `searchAfter` paging.
